For the web hacking part of the Northwave course at ITVitae, our assignment was to perform a penetration test using the skills we were taught by Northwave. A fictional website was made available, which used the unaltered Freewebshop software from freewebshop.org, as it was made available around 2009. As it had a lot of vulnerabilities, it was an ideal target to be used. This was especially true, as there were no writeups available about it, as opposed to web applications that are vulnerable by design, such as DVWA, Juiceshop and bWAPP.
